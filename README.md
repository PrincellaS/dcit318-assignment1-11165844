# Overview
This repository contains three C# console applications that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts including user input handling, data validation, conditional logic, and method organization.

# Applications

# Grade Calculator

Converts numerical grades (0-100) to letter grades using standard grading scale. The program validates user input and uses conditional statements to determine the appropriate letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F). Key features include input validation with TryParse and organized code structure with separate methods for grade calculation.

# Ticket Price Calculator

Calculates movie ticket prices based on customer age. Regular tickets cost GHC 10, while children (12 and under) and seniors (65 and above) receive discounted tickets at GHC 7. The application demonstrates the use of different data types (int for age, decimal for currency) and conditional logic for discount eligibility.

# Triangle Type Identifier

Determines triangle type (Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene) based on three side lengths. The program validates that the given sides can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem and handles floating-point precision issues when comparing side lengths. It includes comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks.
